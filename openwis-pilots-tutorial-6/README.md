## OWT-6: Deploying an Angular web application in Karaf
Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. It combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

This tutorial will create:
1. A single-page web application, much like the one in OWT-5
2. A mechanism which will consume the service(s) defined in OWT-4, built on the Angular framework.
