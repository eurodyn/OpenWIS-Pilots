## OWT-2: SOA using OSGi and Apache Karaf
OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).

Apache Karaf is a small OSGi based runtime that provides a lightweight container onto which various components and applications can be deployed.

This tutorial will cover the following topics:
1. OSGi basics: Bundles & Services.
2. OSGi implementations: Apache Felix, Eclipse Equinox, Knopflerfish, ProSyst.
2. OSGi Karaf features.
4. Deploying bundles on Karaf.
